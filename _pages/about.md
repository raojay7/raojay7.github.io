I am Jun Rao, a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).
I published several papers at top conferences and international journals, including ACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, MM, TMM, CIKM, and IPM.
My long-term research goal is to build socially intelligent embodied agents with the ability to perceive and engage in \textbf{multimodal} human communication. 
As steps towards this goal, his research focuses on 
1) the fundamentals of \textbf{multimodal learning}, specifically the representation, translation, fusion, and alignment of heterogeneous data sources,
2) human-centered \textbf{language, vision}, and their applications, 
3) the real-world deployment of \textbf{efficiency} involves both the amount of \textbf{computation} and \textbf{data} required for (pre-)training and using NLP models .
