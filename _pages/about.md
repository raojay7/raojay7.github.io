I am Jun Rao, a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), co-advised by [Min Zhang](https://zhangmin-nlp-ai.github.io/) and [Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/).
I published several papers at top conferences and international journals (ACM/IEEE Trans), including ACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, MM, TMM, CIKM, and IPM. I have a **strong preference** for methods that are **simple, intuitve and fun**.
My long-term research goal is to build socially intelligent embodied agents with the ability to perceive and engage in **multimodal** human communication. 
As steps towards this goal, my research focuses on 

1) the fundamentals of **multimodal learning**, specifically the representation, translation, fusion, and alignment of heterogeneous data sources,
   
2) human-centered **language, vision**, and their applications,
 
3) the real-world deployment of **efficiency** involves both the amount of **computation** and **data** required for (pre-, post-)training and using **LLMs**.

# Personal information

I like playing table tennis. I have won the eighth place in the team of Guangdong Provincial Games for college students, the fourth place in the mixed doubles of Shenzhen District Competition, the fifth place in the Fifth Shenzhen Cup Amateur Open Competition, the 16th place in the singles and team of Shenzhen Municipal Games for the mass group, and the second place in the team of Huawei Table Tennis 2024.
