I am Jun Rao, a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).
I published several papers at top conferences and international journals, including ACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, MM, TMM, CIKM, and IPM.
My long-term research goal is to build socially intelligent embodied agents with the ability to perceive and engage in \textbf{multimodal} human communication. 
As steps towards this goal, his research focuses on 
1) the fundamentals of **multimodal learning**, specifically the representation, translation, fusion, and alignment of heterogeneous data sources,
2) human-centered **language, vision**, and their applications, 
3) the real-world deployment of **efficiency** involves both the amount of **computation** and **data** required for (pre-, post-)training and using **LLMs** models .
