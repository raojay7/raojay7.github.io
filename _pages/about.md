Jun Rao is currently pursuing the Ph.D.degree in Harbin Institute of Technology, shenzhen.  
He published several papers at top conferences and international journals, including ACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, MM, TMM, CIKM, and IPM.
His long-term research goal is to build socially intelligent embodied agents with the ability to perceive and engage in \textbf{multimodal} human communication. 
As steps towards this goal, his research focuses on 
1) the fundamentals of \textbf{multimodal learning}, specifically the representation, translation, fusion, and alignment of heterogeneous data sources,
2) human-centered \textbf{language, vision}, and their applications, 
3) the real-world deployment of \textbf{efficiency} involves both the amount of \textbf{computation} and \textbf{data} required for (pre-)training and using NLP models .
